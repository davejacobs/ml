ML
--

ML is a machine-learning library/framework for Clojure. It's currently a pet project, but I am trying to keep algorithms as general as possible. Feel free to fork, experiment, and contribute!

To implement
------------

- <del>Linear regression</del>
- <del>Logistic regression</del>
- <del>k-nearest neighbors</del>
- Regularization for linear regression
- <del>Regularization for logistic regression</del>
- Feature discovery for logistic regression using a neural network
